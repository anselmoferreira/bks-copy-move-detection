# bks-copy-move-detection
Source code related to our scientific paper "Behavior Knowledge Space-Based Fusion for Copy-Move Forgery Detection", published by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Author: Anselmo Ferreira

INSTRUCTIONS

The source code is divided in two parts:

1. Repeat Experiments: you can re-run our experiments and check the effectiveness of our proposed approach in a 5X2 cross validation scenario on the CPHPALL (uncompressed images) dataset. Results can vary a little bit depending on the precison your CPU uses to calculate the probabilities.

2. Do your own BKS: Here you can check how the multiscale BKS is built and also can change the code to include your images and/or compare your approach against ours.

In both cases you must download a folder called aux. Available to download in ftp://www.recod.ic.unicamp.br/2016-tip-copy-move-dataset

If you use Filezilla to download our file called aux, you must configure it according to the instructions in folder called instructions_filezilla in this git repository.

Please extract this folder in the same folder as the source code folders are in your PC.

If you use this code in your research don't forget to cite our work:
